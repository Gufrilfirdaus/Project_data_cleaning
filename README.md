# Project_data_cleaning

Project Description :
This project focuses on data cleaning, a crucial step in the data science pipeline to enhance dataset quality. The goal is to prepare the data for machine learning models by handling outliers and addressing non-normal data distributions.

Key Steps : 
Outlier Handling:
Utilized the InterQuartile Range (IQR) method to detect and handle outliers.
Analysis revealed significant outliers in columns such as Averooms, MedInc, AveBedrms, and AveOccup, impacting the data distribution.

Data Insights:
Mean values in several columns showed a right-skewed distribution.
Box plots were employed to visualize and identify outliers.
The overall data distribution deviated from a normal distribution.

Data Visualization:
Created visualizations such as box plots and histograms to understand data distribution and detect anomalies.

Final Outcome:
The cleaned dataset is now better structured and ready for advanced analysis and machine learning model development, free from significant outliers.
